# Painting the Fence

Given a fence with n posts and k colors, find out the number of ways of painting the fence so that not more than two consecutive posts have the same colors. Since the answer can be large return it modulo 109 + 7.

```
Input:
n = 3
k = 2
Output: 6
Explanation:
Let the 2 colors be 'R' and 'B'.
We have following possible combinations:
1. RRB
2. RBR
3. RBB
4. BRR
5. BRB
6. BBR

```

```java
class Solution {
    long countWays(int n, int k) {
        int mod = 1000000007;

        // Base cases
        if (n == 1) return k % mod;
        if (n == 2) return (k * k) % mod; // Two fences, either the same or different colors

        // Initial values for the first two fences
        long same = k % mod; // Number of ways when the last two fences have the same color
        long diff = (k * (k - 1)) % mod; // Number of ways when the last two fences have different colors
        long total = (same + diff) % mod; // Total number of ways for the first two fences

        // Loop for remaining fences (from 3rd to nth fence)
        for (int i = 3; i <= n; i++) {
            same = diff % mod; // Last two same colors comes from previous 'diff'
            diff = (total * (k - 1)) % mod; // Last two different colors
            total = (same + diff) % mod; // Total ways for the current fence
        }

        return total;
    }
}

```
